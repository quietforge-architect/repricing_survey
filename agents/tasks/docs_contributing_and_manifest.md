Task: CONTRIBUTING.md + project.json Manifest

Context: Onboard collaborators with contribution rules and a lightweight manifest describing modules and schemas.

10-point prompt:
1) Draft CONTRIBUTING.md with branching, commit style, and PR review rules.
2) Define coding standards for scripts (lint, formatting, minimal dependencies).
3) Include a quickstart for local dev and how to run tests.
4) Add a section for security/privacy considerations (no PII commits).
5) Create `project.json` with name, version, modules, and paths.
6) Document data schemas and their file locations in the manifest.
7) Reference task ownership and escalation contacts in CONTRIBUTING.
8) Add guidance for updating the survey schema and Apps Script safely.
9) Include a checklist for adding new tasks to `agents/tasks`.
10) Validate both files render clearly in GitHub and are concise.
