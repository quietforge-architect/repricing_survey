Task: Dashboard Integration (Aggregated Metrics)

Context: Visualize aggregated item-level and survey metrics together in a lightweight dashboard.

10-point prompt:
1) Identify core KPIs (buy box %, avg rank, satisfaction scores).
2) Define a single JSON or view that merges safe survey aggregates with item metrics.
3) Choose a simple dashboard stack (Looker Studio, Streamlit, or static HTML+JS).
4) Build minimal charts/tables first; keep it fast and clear.
5) Add filters for date range, category, and seller model.
6) Document data refresh cadence and source locations.
7) Provide a script or Make target to regenerate inputs.
8) Add screenshots or gifs to `/docs/` for onboarding.
9) Include an accessibility check (colors, contrast, labels).
10) Keep dependencies minimal; prefer portable, no-login options.
