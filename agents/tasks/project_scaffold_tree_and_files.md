Task: Project Scaffold (Folder Tree + Base Files)

Context: Generate the initial repository structure and placeholders aligned to the integration blueprint.

10-point prompt:
1) Propose a concise folder tree covering app, docs, agents, tools, and scripts.
2) Add `.gitkeep` files where empty dirs are required.
3) Scaffold minimal README stubs per major folder.
4) Include example config/env templates where needed.
5) Provide a make/script task to bootstrap the scaffold automatically.
6) Keep names consistent with references in the chat and code.
7) Avoid over-engineering; only include what's referenced.
8) Add a quick verification checklist post-scaffold.
9) Ensure Windows/macOS/Linux-friendly paths and scripts.
10) Document how to remove or extend sections later without breakage.
